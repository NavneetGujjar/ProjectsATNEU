The above link is for the project that I have created based on the Movies and Oscars Data. 
I have used R to clean the data from scratch and SQL to map data from different files based on the common field.
After getting the data, we plotted the graphs by using Flourish.studio and Data wrapper tools.

There are a variety of graphs that we have plotted. To name some we have bar charts, line graphs, alluvial charts, Treemap graphs and so on.
